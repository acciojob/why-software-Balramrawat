	 <h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>

	<p>
        Becoming a software developer has always been a passion of mine because it allows me to create innovative solutions to 
      real-world problems. I am fascinated by the power of technology to connect people, automate tasks, and transform industries.
      The idea of writing code to bring ideas to life is incredibly fulfilling, and I enjoy the constant challenge of learning and 
      adapting in a field that is ever-evolving. Moreover, software development provides endless opportunities to collaborate with 
      others, solve complex problems, and make a meaningful impact on the world.
